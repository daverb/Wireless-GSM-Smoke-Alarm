Wireless GSM Smoke Alarm - Final Year Engineering Project
========================

###Overview:
This repository contains the Arduino code used in my Final Year B. Eng Electronic Engineering Project.

This project utilised two Arduino boards, a Siemens TC35i GSM module, a smoke detector, and a RF transmitter/receiver pair to create a wireless smoke detection system that can make a phone call to alert a home owner to a fire in their property. The primary purpose of this was to provide an additional tactile warning to people who may be deaf or hard of hearing.
